## Getting Started

If you don't have `pnpm` isntalled, you can run the following to install it globally:

```sh
npm i -g pnpm
```

You can then run `pnpm i` to install all the dependencies.

### Libraries in use

- [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) (install VSCode [Tailwind CSS IntelliSense](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss) to make your life easier/)
- [Lucide](https://lucide.dev/icons/) (in case you need any icons for any components you're building)
